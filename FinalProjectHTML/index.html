    <p>In the world of novels, every page turned is a new adventure, and every story read leaves an imprint on the soul. Through books, I have traveled to distant lands, lived countless lives, and discovered endless possibilitiesâ€”making novel reading a lifelong journey I never want to end. Reading novels is more than just a hobby; it is a refuge, a teacher, and a lifelong companion in my journey through life.</p>
